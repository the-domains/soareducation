or

NOW!
With 165 A2 videos and 124 AS videos you are going to find exactly what you
want here. Playlists are made up of videos from the creator and others compiled
from around the web. This does mean however, that there will be gaps in
quality. Some will just be silents PowerPoints while others will be more
interactive. But for the sheer breadth of biology topics this channel has makes
it amazing.

A
site with no targeted exam board and a huge spectrum of topics in a neatly
presented manner. The site covers Human Biology, Plant Biology and Ecology,
Biochemistry and Microbiology. The notes are created by students in a condensed
form allowing for effective revision. Each page may consist of diagrams,
definitions, videos and information. It is all laid out in a simple, clutter
free manner meaning you can find what you want quickly and start revising.
Perfect for that last minute recap or making quiz cards with. The site also works
on mobile for great revision on the go!

This site is for general
revision though it has a large focus on the AQA syllabus. The site covers Cells
& Molecules, Evolution &Ecosystems, Diseases and Human Biology. It also
briefly covers the 5 topics of the AQA syllabus. Each page consists of diagrams
and information. What makes this site great though, is its navigation. The site
bar on the right allows you to quickly scan for topics that you are interested
in and it allows you quickly jump to this area. The notes are concise and easy
to read. Thought the lack of videos or questions is disappointing. A site for
making quiz cards if not for anything else.

Fully based on the AQA(B)
Syllabus. But if you are on these exam boards this is a great site for
revision. For each module there are notes which are packed full of information
and informative diagrams. These notes will give you the full picture on each
module. A key facts section gives you the vital information you need to know
while the questions section really makes this site stand out. There are a
number of questions on each sub-topic. Ranging from 1 to 3 marks questions with
instant feedback. This allows you to quickly see your progress. The site also
offers you Word version of all the notes, bullet point exam answers, and links
to exercises to complete and a limited section of PowerPoints. Not every topic
will have questions which is disappointing and some of the notes are just too
long. But a handy site to get the full picture and practice some questions.

This site must be the largest repository of biology notes on the internet. If
you want a set of notes your best bet is to look here first. The list run from
Animals all the way to Viruses. While this is great the site is ugly and a pain
to find what you are looking for in the first place. The notes are the same,
with simple diagrams and text. But for sheer volume of information you need to
check this site out.

A site focused primarily on
Cells; Cell Biology, Immunology, Microbiology and Microscopy. You have three
types of resources; text based, video based and interactive pages. The text
pages are great; notes are condensed, with links to other content to help you
understand what is going on. The pages have gifs and diagrams and there is
never too much information. The videos are information and the site offers
"Connections" to help aim your study. These could be for quizzes of news
articles. The animations are great to get to look at what is going on inside
the cell. The resources are sometimes attached to PowerPoints to download or a
worksheet. The study section allows you to easily find any Worksheets, Puzzles,
Quizzes or PowerPoints the site holds. Although this list is not extensive this
is an amazing site for all types of learners.
